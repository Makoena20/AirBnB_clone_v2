## About

This repository contains the second version of the AirBnB clone project. The project aims to replicate the core functionality of the popular Airbnb platform, allowing users to list properties, search for properties, make reservations, and manage bookings.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to further develop and enhance the functionality of the original AirBnB clone. We aim to improve upon existing features, fix any bugs or issues, and potentially introduce new features to make the application more robust and user-friendly.
